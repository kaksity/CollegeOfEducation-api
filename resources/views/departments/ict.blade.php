This is in line with National Board of Technical Education NBTE directives that colleges must be ICT-compliant especially as regards to E-library services. The center was set up to develop, facilitate and promote administrative leadership, staff collaboration and training as well as cross-departmental efforts to advance the course of research and development in the college.
